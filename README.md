Django dropzone upload
======================

Example project for integrating dropzone.js with Django.

Introduction
------------

[Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com) by [Matias
Meno](https://github.com/enyo) is a javascript library for drag and drop file
uploading. It is very light and simple to configure and extend.

Django-dropzone-fileupload tries to set up a minimal Django project using a
small `fileupload` app that sets up a page with a Dropzone.js form. This
project is trying to be as simple as possible to be easy to understand.

Howto
-----

We assume you have git, python and python-virtualenv already installed.

* Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/sigurdga/django-dropzone-fileupload.git
* Change directory: cd django-dropzone-fileupload
* Create virtualenv: virtualenv venv
* Activate virtualenv: source venv/bin/activate
* Install dependencies into virtualenv: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run development server: python manage.py runserver
* Open browser at localhost:8000

Limitations
-----------

Dropzone.js claims to work for modern browsers:

* Chrome 7+
* Firefox 4+
* IE 10+
* Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy)
* Safari 6+

Django-dropzone-fileupload does not try to do anything more than Dropzone in
its simplest form, so no delete, no listing of already uploaded, etc. in this
project.
